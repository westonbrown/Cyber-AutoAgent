    <p>
        Machine Learning (ML) is a fascinating subset of artificial technology that empowers software applications to predict outcomes more accurately without direct human input. ML algorithms analyze historical data to forecast new results, continually learning and adapting.

    <p>
        Recommendation systems are a prime example of machine learning applications. Major companies like Netflix and Amazon implement ML to tailor their services to individual tastes based on user history.

    <h2>Core Components of Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>
        The core of machine learning involves supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> The model is trained on labeled data, learning to predict outputs from inputs.</li>
            <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> The model identifies patterns and relationships in datasets without any labels.</li>
            <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Models learn to make decisions by receiving rewards for successful actions.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
    <p>
        Beyond recommendations, ML has transformative applications across many sectors:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> From diagnosing diseases faster to predicting patient outcomes, ML is revolutionizing medicine.</li>
            <li><strong>Finance:</strong> ML drives algorithms for real-time fraud detection, risk assessment, and automated trading.</li>
            <li><strong>Autonomous Vehicles:</strong> Self-driving cars use ML to navigate safely by interpreting sensor data in real time.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
    <p>
        As ML technology evolves, its potential applications seem limitless, promising even greater integration into daily life and various industries.
