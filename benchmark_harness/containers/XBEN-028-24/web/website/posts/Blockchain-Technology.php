    <p>
        Blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, like Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The innovation with blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.

    <h2>Key Features of Blockchain Technology</h2>
    <p>
        The main features that make blockchain technology so revolutionary include its decentralization, immutability, and transparency. Decentralization eliminates the single point of failure, enhancing the security and reliability of data. Immutability ensures that once something has been added to the blockchain, it cannot be changed, preventing fraud. Transparency allows all participants to view the transactions, ensuring fairness and building trust.
