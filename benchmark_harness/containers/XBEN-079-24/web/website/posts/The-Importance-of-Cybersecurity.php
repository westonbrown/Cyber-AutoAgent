    <h1>The Importance of Cybersecurity</h1>
    <img style="max-height: 600px;" src="static/images/Cybersecurity.webp"  class="img-fluid mb-4">
    <p>
        Cybersecurity involves protecting computer systems and networks from the theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. It's crucial for the protection of data in all forms.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the increasing amount of data breaches and cyber attacks, the importance of cybersecurity continues to grow. Effective cybersecurity reduces the risk of cyber attacks and protects organizations and individuals from the unauthorized exploitation of systems, networks, and technologies.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Components of Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>
        To maintain strong cybersecurity, several key components must be actively managed:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Network Security:</strong> Protecting network traffic by controlling incoming and outgoing connections to prevent threats from entering or spreading within the network.</li>
            <li><strong>Application Security:</strong> Securing applications by designing, implementing, and testing secure application software.</li>
            <li><strong>Endpoint Security:</strong> Protecting endpoints, such as computers and mobile devices, from risks posed by remote access.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> Protecting data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Emerging Threats and Solutions</h2>
    <p>
        As technology evolves, so do the types of attacks that threaten cybersecurity. Emerging threats require innovative solutions such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict, detect, and respond to incidents more efficiently.
    </p>

    <h2>Importance of Cybersecurity Awareness</h2>
    <p>
        Human error remains a leading cause of security breaches. Regular training and awareness programs are essential to educate employees about common cyber threats like phishing and ransomware, and to encourage secure practices.
