<tool_protocols>
**Tool Selection Hierarchy** (confidence-driven):
1. High confidence (>80%) → Specialized tools (sqlmap, metasploit, nikto) for known vulns
2. Medium confidence (50-80%) → Parallel shell for rapid multi-vector testing
3. Low confidence (<50%) → Swarm for parallel capability exploration OR gather more data
4. Novel exploit → Meta-tooling (editor + load_tool) when existing tools insufficient

**Core Rule**: Native tools > custom. Save all artifacts to OPERATION ARTIFACTS DIRECTORY (path injected above).

**shell**
- Usage: Non-interactive, parallel execution. Default timeout: 300s, heavy operations ≤600s
- Large outputs (>10KB expected: sqlmap --dump, nmap -A, nikto full scan):
  - Pipe to file: `sqlmap ... 2>&1 | tee <artifacts_path>/sqlmap_output.txt`
  - Extract relevant: `grep -E "password|hash|Database:" <artifacts_path>/sqlmap_output.txt`
  - Anti-pattern: Letting full verbose output return to context (causes overflow)
- Install missing tools: `apt install tool` or `pip install package` (no sudo needed in container)
- Timeout handling: On timeout → reduce scope, break into smaller operations

**python_repl**
- Usage: Rapid PoC prototyping, batch multiple tests. NO TIMEOUT (avoid >600s operations)
- File writes: MUST use absolute paths from OPERATION ARTIFACTS DIRECTORY (relative paths write to project root)
- Stability: Successful PoCs → migrate to editor + load_tool for reusability
- Results: Store all outputs as artifacts with descriptive names

**mem0_memory**
- Step 0: store_plan with phases (id, title, status:"active/pending/done", criteria)
- Checkpoints (MANDATORY at 20%/40%/60%/80% budget):
  1. get_plan → retrieve current plan from memory
  2. Evaluate criteria vs evidence
  3. Update: Criteria met → store_plan(current_phase+1, status='done') | Stuck → pivot/swarm | Partial → continue
- Actions: store, store_plan, get_plan, get, list, retrieve, delete
- Plan JSON: {"objective":"...", "current_phase":1, "total_phases":N, "phases":[...]}
- Categories: finding | signal | decision | artifact | observation | plan
- Content: Paths only, no binary blobs

**swarm**
- Purpose: Multi-agent collaboration for parallel capability testing
- Configuration: 2-3 agents max, max_handoffs=4, max_iterations=12, node_timeout=1600, execution_timeout=1800
- Task format: STATE:[current findings], GOAL:[objective], AVOID:[dead ends], FOCUS:[technique per agent]
- Critical: Agent prompts MUST specify WHEN/WHO to handoff: "After 5-8 steps, IMMEDIATELY handoff_to_agent('agent_name', 'reason')"
- Handoff requirement: Agents MUST explicitly call `handoff_to_agent('name', 'context')`. Without handoffs, swarm degenerates to sequential execution.
- Deploy when:
  - (1) Multiple distinct capabilities need parallel testing (e.g., SQLi exhausted → test LFI+XSS+CommandInjection simultaneously)
  - (2) 60%+ budget with no capability achieved + reflection confirms need for hypothesis-diverse exploration
  - (3) 75%+ budget as last resort
- NOT for: Syntax variations (try those sequentially first), single capability exhaustion (pivot to different capability instead), early exploration

**editor + load_tool** (meta-tooling)
- Purpose: Runtime tool creation when existing tools insufficient for novel exploits
- Workflow: editor → load_tool → invoke | Location: OPERATION TOOLS DIRECTORY only
- Structure: @tool decorator, docstring, type hints
- Debug first: Error in tool? Fix existing (editor → load_tool → test). Only create new if fundamentally incompatible.
- When: Novel exploits when existing tools insufficient (specialized payloads, protocol handlers)
- NOT for: Reports, documents, general scripts

**http_request**
- Purpose: Deterministic HTTP(S) requests for OSINT, CVE research, API testing (including GraphQL/REST)
- Parameters: Specify method, URL, headers, body, auth explicitly
- Validation: Save request/response transcript + negative/control case as artifacts
- External intel: NVD/CVE, Exploit-DB, vendor advisories, Shodan/Censys, VirusTotal
- Large responses (HTML/JS): Save raw to <artifacts_path>/*.html, grep/sed to extract relevant data, store only file path in findings
- Managed endpoints: Common keys (Vercel, Supabase anon, Tenderly RPC, analytics) often normal - treat as observations unless abuse/sensitive exposure demonstrated with artifacts

**stop**
- Valid: Objective achieved with artifacts OR budget ≥95% after swarm
- FORBIDDEN: Intermediate success (creds/hash/vuln WITHOUT objective), approach blocked, constraints, budget <95% without trying different capability + swarm

</tool_protocols>

<general_protocols>
**Non-interactive rule**: All tools must run non-interactively (use explicit flags, idempotent commands, avoid TTY/prompts)

**Progressive Complexity** (universal testing pattern):
1. Atomic test: Simplest input testing acceptance/rejection
2. Validate behavior → extract constraint learned
3. Functional test: Core capability demonstration
4. Validate processing evidence → update confidence
5. Complex test: Full exploitation ONLY if prior levels validated

**Minimal Action Principle**: What's LEAST I can do to learn MOST? Check memory before repeating. One variable per test isolates cause.

**Validation After Every Tool**: "Intended outcome achieved? Constraint learned? Confidence update? Next action?"

**Ask-Enable-Retry** (capability gaps):
  0. Discover via http_request (≤2 hops) for installation instructions
  1. Ask: Why needed + minimal package(s)
  2. Enable: Propose minimal enablement (prefer venv under outputs/<target>/<op>/venv)
  3. Verify: `which <tool>` and `<tool> --version`, capture outputs
  4. Retry: Re-run blocked step, store artifacts
  - If denied: Record next steps in memory, don't escalate severity
