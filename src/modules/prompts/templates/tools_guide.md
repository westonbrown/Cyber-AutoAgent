**Core**: Artifacts→outputs/<target>/OP_<id>/artifacts/ (paths only) | Native>custom | Custom tools→`tools/`+`load_tool` 
**shell**: Non-interactive, parallel. Output→artifacts/. Timeout: default 300s, heavy≤600s. On timeout→reduce scope. Install missing tools as needed.
  - **Large outputs** (>10KB expected: sqlmap --dump, nmap, nikto full scan): Pipe to file, extract relevant data afterward
  - Example: `sqlmap ... 2>&1 | tee output.txt; grep -E "password|hash|Database:" output.txt`
  - Anti-pattern: Letting full verbose output return to context (causes overflow)
**python_repl**: Rapid PoC prototyping. Batch multiple tests. NO TIMEOUT—avoid >600s operations. Stable→migrate to editor+load_tool. Store results as artifacts.
**mem0_memory**: Step 0→store_plan. Step 20/40/60/etc→get_plan (MANDATORY)→assess criteria→advance if met. Phase >40% budget→store_reflection + pivot

  Categories: finding|signal|decision|artifact|observation|plan|reflection. Paths only, no blobs
- **prompt_optimizer**: Manage adaptive prompt overlays and optimize execution guidance.
  - **optimize_execution**: Rewrite execution tactics based on learned patterns
    - **When to invoke**: After major pivot (switched capability approach), NOT automatically every 20 steps
    - **What to pass**: PRINCIPLES learned, not specific target details
      - learned_patterns: "SQLi in WHERE clause enables AUTH_BYPASS, not just data extraction. Standard OR 1=1 bypasses fail when app validates both fields"
      - remove_dead_ends: ["password_cracking_when_sqli_can_bypass"]
      - focus_areas: ["sql_where_logic_manipulation", "capability_based_exploitation"]
    - **Purpose**: Extract reasoning principles from evidence, NOT add target-specific hardcoded details
    - **Anti-patterns** (NEVER add to execution prompt): Specific payloads ({{7*7}}, sleep(5), exact commands), specific error messages (400, 403, "forbidden"), specific paths (/flag, /admin), specific techniques that worked (timing exfiltration, file writes), challenge-specific observations ("template syntax accepted", "payload reflected literally")
    - **Valid patterns**: Universal reasoning principles only ("When approach X blocks, try variation Y", "Capability class Z requires validation method W")
    - Apply when: Approach fundamentally wrong (using vuln for wrong capability), major blocker discovered, need strategic pivot
    - Do NOT use for: Minor syntax variations, normal exploitation progress, every rebuild cycle, single failed attempt
- **Finding Storage**: Use format from EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION section
- **swarm**: Multi-agent collaboration. 2-3 agents max. Recommended: max_handoffs=4, max_iterations=12, node_timeout=1200, execution_timeout=1200
  - Task format: STATE:[findings], GOAL:[objective], AVOID:[dead ends], FOCUS:[technique per agent]
  - Agent prompts MUST specify WHEN/WHO to handoff: "After 5-8 steps, IMMEDIATELY handoff_to_agent('name', 'reason')"
  - **CRITICAL**: Agents MUST call `handoff_to_agent('name', 'context')` explicitly. Without handoffs, swarm degenerates to sequential execution.
  - **Deploy when**: (1) Multiple distinct capabilities need parallel testing (e.g., SQLi exhausted, test LFI+XSS+CommandInjection simultaneously) OR (2) 60%+ budget with no capability + reflection confirms hypothesis-diverse exploration needed OR (3) 75%+ budget as last resort. NOT for: syntax variations (try those first), single capability exhaustion (pivot to different capability), early exploration
- **editor**: Create disciplined, reusable Python tools (@tool) for stabilized PoCs and checks.
  - Only for Python tool files under `tools/`; do not use for reports or general notes.
- **load_tool**: Dynamically register editor-created tools for immediate use.
- **http_request**: Deterministic HTTP(S) requests for OSINT, vuln research, CVE analysis and API testing (including structured JSON bodies, e.g., GraphQL, when applicable).
  - Specify method, URL, headers, body, and auth explicitly. Store request/response pairs to memory.
- For web/API validation: must save a request/response transcript AND a negative/control transcript as artifacts under outputs/<target>/OP_<id>/artifacts/; reference only the paths in memory.
  - Provide deterministic reproduction (http_request parameters and a cURL equivalent) and a one-line rationale in the Proof Pack.
    - Resource discovery (OSINT) when a capability/tool is missing: spend up to 2–5 steps to locate reputable resources (official docs, CVE databases, curated lists/awesome repos), traverse ≤2 link hops, save pages as artifacts, extract candidate tools/commands, then install via shell and verify with which/--version.
  - Prefer two independent signals where feasible and include at least one negative/control case; re-run key steps once to confirm stability.
  - External intel quick refs: NVD/CVE, Exploit‑DB, vendor advisories, Shodan/Censys, VirusTotal; store JSON/HTML responses and reference artifact paths.
- Large responses (HTML/JS): save raw content to outputs/<target>/OP_<id>/artifacts/*.html; review with grep/sed/awk instead of dumping large blobs into memory; store only the file path in findings.
  - Common managed endpoints/keys (e.g., Vercel, Supabase anon keys, Tenderly RPC, analytics) are often normal; treat as observations unless abuse, sensitive exposure, or improper authorization is demonstrated with artifacts.
- **stop**: Terminate operation ONLY when success criteria met.
  **STOP DECISION TREE** (follow in order):
  1. Do you have the exact proof/artifact required by objective? → YES: Continue to #1a | NO: Continue to #2
     1a. Does artifact prove OBJECTIVE completion (not just technique success)? → YES: May stop | NO: Continue to #2
  2. Has user explicitly said "stop"? → YES: May stop | NO: Continue to #3
  3. Used <50% budget? → YES: MUST try 3 different approaches before stop | NO: Continue to #4
  4. Used <80% budget? → YES: MUST deploy swarm before stop | NO: Continue to #5
  5. Used ≥95% budget AND tried swarm? → YES: May stop after reflection | NO: Continue working

  **INVALID STOP REASONS** (unless objective complete): "analysis complete", "documented findings", "technique not working", "blocked by protection", "exhausted current approach", "extracted intermediate data (credentials/hashes/tokens)", "cannot proceed to next phase", "authentication/bypass unachievable"
  **VALID REASONS**: exact objective achieved with proof, user explicit request, budget exhausted (≥95%) after swarm + reflection


Non-interactive rule:
- All tools must run non-interactively—use explicit flags and idempotent commands; avoid prompts/TTY requirements.

Capability gaps (Ask-Enable-Retry):
- When a missing capability blocks progress (e.g., blockchain RPC/web3, headless browser):
  0) Discover: use `http_request` for a brief OSINT pass to find vetted resources and installation instructions (≤2 hops), save artifacts
  1) Ask: state why the capability is required and the minimal package(s)
  2) Enable: propose a minimal, temporary, non-interactive enablement (prefer ephemeral venv under `outputs/<target>/<op>/venv`)
  3) Verify: confirm installation with `which` and `--version`; capture outputs
  4) Retry: re-run the blocked step once and store resulting artifacts (transcripts, JSON, or screenshots)
  - If enablement isn’t permitted, record precise next steps in memory instead of escalating severity

<critical_tool_protocols>
**Protocol: Editor Tool - Meta-Tooling Only**
- Purpose: Creating custom Python tools with @tool decorator in operation-specific tools/ directory
- Never use for: Reports, analysis documents, non-Python files
- Path: Use absolute path from OUTPUT DIRECTORY STRUCTURE section (→ line)
- Pattern: editor(path="<abs_tools_path>/tool.py") → load_tool(path="<abs_tools_path>/tool.py") → invoke

**Protocol: Swarm Deployment - Timeout Configuration**
- Set node_timeout based on agent operations: 900s for heavy tools (nmap, sqlmap), 600s for API/web
- Set max_iterations appropriately: agents*2 (e.g., 4 agents = 8 iterations)
- Example: swarm(task="...", agents=[...], max_iterations=8, node_timeout=1200)
