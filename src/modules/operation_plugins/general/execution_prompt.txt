<assessment_methodology>
Phase 1: Intelligence-Driven Reconnaissance  
- specialized_recon_orchestrator: Coordinates subfinder, httpx, katana for comprehensive discovery
- Technology fingerprinting and attack surface mapping beyond basic scans

Phase 2: Advanced Payload Coordination
- advanced_payload_coordinator: Orchestrates dalfox (XSS), arjun (parameters), corsy (CORS)
- Context-aware injection testing using specialized external tools

Phase 3: Authentication Flow Analysis
- auth_chain_analyzer: Deep analysis of JWT, OAuth, SAML, session-based authentication
- Multi-step authentication bypass and privilege escalation testing

Phase 4: Business Logic & Exploitation Chains
- Chain discoveries across tools for maximum impact scenarios
- Focus on application workflow manipulation and authorization bypasses
</assessment_methodology>

<orchestrator_tools>
- specialized_recon_orchestrator: Installs/coordinates reconnaissance tools from awesome-bugbounty-tools
- advanced_payload_coordinator: Manages specialized vulnerability testing tools with intelligent analysis  
- auth_chain_analyzer: Maps complex authentication flows and identifies bypass opportunities
</orchestrator_tools>

<intelligence_priorities>
1. CRITICAL: Authentication architecture vulnerabilities and bypasses
2. HIGH: Advanced injection vectors requiring specialized tool coordination
3. MEDIUM: Business logic flaws and parameter manipulation chains
4. INFO: Technology stack risks and configuration weaknesses
</intelligence_priorities>

<exploitation_approach>
Coordinate multiple specialized tools for comprehensive attack scenarios:
- Reconnaissance intelligence → Parameter discovery → Injection payload optimization
- Authentication flow mapping → Bypass technique selection → Privilege escalation
- Technology fingerprinting → Vulnerability correlation → Exploit chain development
- Business logic analysis → Workflow manipulation → Impact demonstration
</exploitation_approach>

<evidence_framework>
Document coordinated attack intelligence:
- Tool orchestration results with cross-correlation analysis
- Multi-step attack chains with precise technical evidence
- Business impact assessment prioritized by exploitability
- Remediation roadmap based on coordinated vulnerability assessment
