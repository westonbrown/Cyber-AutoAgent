<domain_focus>
Comprehensive security assessment across infrastructure, web applications, and services.
Adapt methodology based on discovered attack surface.
</domain_focus>

<assessment_priorities>
1. Infrastructure: Exposed services, version vulnerabilities, misconfigurations
2. Web Applications: OWASP risks, business logic, authentication weaknesses  
3. APIs: Endpoint enumeration, parameter fuzzing, authorization bypass
4. Network: Lateral movement paths, trust relationships, segmentation gaps
</assessment_priorities>

<module_tools>
- quick_recon: Fast port/service discovery with technology identification
- identify_technology: Web stack fingerprinting and security header analysis
Load with: load_tool(tool_name="quick_recon")
</module_tools>

<general_patterns>
Start broad, then deep-dive based on findings:
- Unknown target: quick_recon → Full enumeration → Targeted testing
- Web-heavy: Technology stack → OWASP methodology → Business logic
- Infrastructure: Network mapping → Service versions → Known CVEs
- Mixed environment: Identify crown jewels → Map attack paths → Chain exploits
</general_patterns>

<evidence_focus>
For general assessments, document:
- Attack surface size and exposure
- Quick wins vs strategic vulnerabilities  
- Exploit chains and lateral movement paths
- Business impact of technical findings
