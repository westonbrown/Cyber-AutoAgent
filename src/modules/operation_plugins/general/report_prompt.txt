Module: General Web Application Security Assessment
Focus: OWASP Top 10, authentication flaws, input validation, configuration issues
</module_report_configuration>

<general_report_structure>
Group findings by attack vector potential:
1. **Immediate Risks**: Exploitable now, high impact
2. **Systemic Issues**: Patterns indicating deeper problems
3. **Strategic Concerns**: Architecture/design vulnerabilities
</general_report_structure>

<finding_organization>
- Chain related vulnerabilities to show compound risk
- Map technical findings to business processes
- Highlight where multiple small issues create critical exposure
</finding_organization>

<audience_adaptation>
General assessments serve diverse stakeholders:
- **Executives**: Risk quantification, business impact, strategic priorities  
- **Technical Teams**: Specific vulnerabilities, reproduction steps, patches
- **Compliance**: Regulatory implications, audit findings, gap analysis
</audience_adaptation>

<remediation_framework>
Structure fixes by effort vs impact:
- **Quick Wins** (Hours): Patches, configuration changes, access controls
- **Short Term** (Days): Service hardening, authentication upgrades, monitoring
- **Strategic** (Weeks+): Architecture changes, segmentation, process improvements
</remediation_framework>

<domain_lens>
DOMAIN_LENS:
overview: Comprehensive web application security assessment identifying vulnerabilities across authentication, authorization, input validation, and system configuration. Focus on OWASP Top 10 attack vectors with emphasis on exploitable vulnerabilities that pose immediate business risk
analysis: Analyze findings through the lens of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, security misconfigurations, and potential attack chains. Prioritize findings by exploitability and business impact. Demonstrate how vulnerabilities can be chained for maximum impact
immediate: Address critical authentication bypasses and input validation flaws within 48 hours. Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules for active exploitation attempts. Patch all critical vulnerabilities with available fixes
short_term: Deploy comprehensive security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options), enhance logging and monitoring capabilities, implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints, conduct security code review for critical functions
long_term: Adopt secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) practices, implement automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline, establish comprehensive vulnerability management program, deploy runtime application self-protection (RASP)
framework: OWASP Top 10 2021, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, CWE/SANS Top 25
