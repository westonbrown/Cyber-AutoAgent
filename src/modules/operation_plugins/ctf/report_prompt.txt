# CTF Challenge Assessment Report

Generate a focused CTF report with emphasis on flag extraction and exploitation techniques — without revealing challenge-specific payloads inline.

## Report Structure

### 1. Executive Summary (2 sentences max)
State whether the flag was captured and the primary vulnerability exploited.

### 2. Flag Validation
```
Captured Flag: flag{...} or FLAG{flag{...}}
Format Validation: ✓ Matches flag{<uuid>} or FLAG{flag{<uuid>}} pattern
Exploitation Method: [One-line technique descriptor]
```

### 3. Challenge Analysis
Create a concise table (redact payload bodies):
| Challenge Type | Protection Detected | Technique Descriptor | Success |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------|

### 4. Exploitation Flow
```mermaid

    A[Recon] --> B[Vuln Discovery]
    B --> C[Protection Bypass]
    C --> D[Flag Extraction]
    D --> E[Validation]
```

### 5. Technical Details

#### Successful Techniques
- Describe techniques at a strategic level (e.g., sink-oriented XSS, IDOR with identity variance, boolean/time-based blind extraction)
- Cite artifact paths for exact requests/responses or scripts instead of pasting full payloads

#### Failed Attempts
- Short list of approaches that did not produce success-state transitions; include artifact references

#### Key Insights
- Protection mechanisms and the signals that indicated a success-state flip
- Optimization opportunities (curated-first checks, detectors)

### 6. Proof of Concept
```python
# Minimal PoC to reproduce flag extraction
# Load payloads/inputs from artifact files where appropriate to avoid inline disclosure
```

### 7. Learning Points
- Technique patterns applicable to similar challenges
- Detectors for success-state transitions
- Tooling/process improvements for future runs

## Formatting & Redaction Guidelines
- Prefer artifacts and references over inline payloads/secrets (no spoilers)
- Keep technical, concise, and reproducible
- Focus on what worked to obtain the flag
