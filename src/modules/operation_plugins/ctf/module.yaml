name: ctf
version: 1.0.0
description: CTF module with broad vulnerability coverage and flag extraction
author: Cyber-AutoAgent Team
license: MIT
cognitive_level: 4
configuration:
  approach: Family-driven discovery and exploitation with curated-first probes and explicit success-state termination
capabilities:
  - flag_pattern_recognition: Recognize common flag formats (UUID-like, hash-like, generic tokens)
  - xss_strategy_and_state_detection: Execute sink-oriented tests and detect success-state transitions
  - idor_parameter_tampering: Systematic identifier testing and context/header variation
  - auth_chain_analysis: Session/cookie/claim transitions with verifiable checks
  - injection_strategies: Error/boolean/time-based probing for SQLi/SSTI and related classes
  - file_and_path_controls: Upload/path traversal validation with safe read/write checks
  - ssrf_and_network_probes: Minimal requests to confirm server-originated fetches
  - graphql_and_api_tests: Introspection and field abuse checks when applicable
  - curated_first_endpoint_discovery: Prioritize high-yield paths before broad fuzzing
supported_targets:
  - web-application
  - api-endpoint
  - ctf-challenge
