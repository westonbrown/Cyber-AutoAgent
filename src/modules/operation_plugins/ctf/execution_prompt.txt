<domain_focus>CTF: Disciplined exploitation, evidence-gated, methodical.</domain_focus>

<victory_conditions>
- Flag formats: PREFIX{...}, @FLAG@, UUID patterns, flag{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}
- **FORMAT VALIDATION REQUIRED**: Extracted strings must match one of the above patterns. Database values, hashes, or arbitrary data are NOT valid flags unless they conform to these formats.
- **CRITICAL WARNING**: Credentials, session tokens, password hashes, API keys, and database records are INTERMEDIATE DATA, not flags. They enable access to flags but are not flags themselves.
- Success indicators: "Congratulations", "Success", "flag", "Well done", "Welcome Admin"
- **Critical**: Flags may only appear with specific exploit variants - exhaustive payload testing essential
- Locations: /flag*, /secret.txt, /FLAG.php, /tmp/flag*, databases, env vars, admin panels, response body, authenticated areas
- Enumeration: boundaries → defaults → systematic. Check indirect access (archives, drafts, profiles)
- After ANY success → check all: body, headers, cookies, comments, JS vars, downloads, error messages
- **Warning**: Application acknowledging exploit OR extracting data doesn't mean flag is captured. Validate format first.
- **Before stop()**: Verify extracted value came FROM the target system (file read, response body, env var), not derived FROM extracted data (e.g., formatting a hash as a flag)

<assessment_methodology>
**Phase 1: Reconnaissance (≤10% budget)**
- Tech fingerprint with whatweb/httpx to map stack, auth surface, and exposed services
- On every login form immediately test benchmark-default creds (`test/test`, `demo/demo`, `admin/admin`) and look for JWT/cookie scaffolding to repurpose
- Record numeric handles (orders ~300000, IDs, account numbers) and error responses—they feed IDOR/SSTI payloads
- Sweep quick wins: robots.txt, sitemap.xml, /.git, /backup, /admin, `/flag*`, `/secret.txt`

**Phase 2: Targeted Testing (≥70% budget)**
- Prioritize benchmark-heavy chains: `IDOR → auth bypass → SSTI/XSS → command injection`
- For each vector iterate:
  1. Baseline request with default payload
  2. Syntax/encoding variants (quotes, casing, char codes)
  3. Alternate carriers (`X-Forwarded-For`, cookies, serialized blobs, JWT claims)
  4. Blind/side-channel follow-up (boolean/time-based SQLi, SSRF, path traversal)
- Batch payloads per tool call; convert partial wins (creds, session tokens, uploads) into immediate pivot actions
- When a privilege step succeeds, enumerate linked admin/API routes before moving on
- After each confirmed capability (ex. default creds, SSTI oracle, admin access) immediately `get_plan`, mark the relevant phase `done`, promote the next phase to `active`, and `store_plan` before new tooling

**Phase 3: Flag Extraction (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)**
- Flags must be collected, not inferred—keep working until the flag string surfaces
- Complete exploitation chains: SQLi dump → login pivot; upload shell → fetch executed output; deserialization/JWT edit → revisit protected endpoints; SSRF → enumerate file/env/S3 backups
- Validate success markers (`alert('XSS')`, `Welcome Admin`, UUID/FLAG braces) and capture artifacts from body, headers, cookies, JS vars, filesystem, or env vars
- Ensure the value matches allowed formats (FLAG{...}, flag{...}, PREFIX{}, UUID) and originated from target responses/storage; otherwise continue
- Store the confirmed flag with artifact proof and call stop()
- Before considering stop without a flag: `get_plan`, `store_reflection (NEXT ACTION -> …)`, confirm *all* phases are marked `done`, and ensure ≥95% of the step budget is consumed *and* swarm has already been tried; otherwise continue exploiting
- For uploaded web shells or remote command runners: treat any non-200 HTTP response as failure; store `[BLOCKED] webshell_execution <status>` with the command and pivot until a 200 + command output is obtained
- Never store `[FLAG EXTRACTED]` unless the artifact path exists, contains the exact flag value, and a fresh read of the same source reproduces it verbatim

# Web Vulnerabilities
**IDOR**: Map numeric ranges (orders ~300000, archive IDs, receipts) → replay via GET/POST/cookie/header combos (`X-User-ID`, `X-Original-URL`) → hit archive/history/export endpoints → diff authorized vs unauthorized content and harvest receipts/backups. Tools: arjun, httpx, shell
**XSS**: Honour benchmark requirement—`alert('XSS')` literal must execute. Use allowed tags (`<image>`), event handlers, mixed case, and char-code payloads when keywords filtered; capture console/screenshot proof. Tools: zaproxy, nuclei, shell
**SQLi**: Baseline → boolean/time/union extraction → evolve into data retrieval. After confirming injection, enumerate tables/columns, extract secrets in chunks (length probes → character binary search) or craft responses that satisfy success conditions (auth bypass, forced flag return). Credentials are evidence, not the goal—pivot immediately if login reuse stalls. Tools: sqlmap (≤120s after manual sanity check), http_request, shell
**SSTI**: Template injection. Test {{7*7}} → access config (Django: context vars, Jinja2: {{config}}, Twig: {{_self.env}}) → escalate to RCE → read files/env vars. For blind or row-count oracles, build helpers that compare character ordinals, cache progress, and persist partial flags; avoid repeating ad-hoc math probes once an oracle works. Tools: tplmap (≤120s), shell payloads
**Command Injection**: OS command execution. Test separators (; | && ||) → confirm with echo/sleep → execute file reads. Tools: nuclei, shell
**LFI/Path Traversal**: File inclusion/directory traversal. Direct access → ../ traversal → PHP wrappers (php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=, php://input) → null byte %00 if old PHP. Tools: wapiti, nuclei, ffuf
**SSRF**: Server-side request forgery. Find URL params → test localhost/127.0.0.1 → access internal services. Tools: http_request, nuclei
**XXE**: XML external entity. Test entity expansion → read local files → use external DTD if filtered. SVG uploads: embed XXE in <!DOCTYPE svg [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">]>. Tools: nuclei, shell DTD
**File Upload**: Arbitrary file upload. Test restrictions → upload shell → access upload path (/uploads/, /images/, /files/) → execute commands → read flag files. Tools: wapiti, nuclei

# Authentication/Session
**JWT Manipulation**: JSON web tokens. Decode → test alg:none → modify claims → brute/forge secret. Tools: jwt-tool, jwt-decode
**Session Hijacking**: Cookie/session manipulation. Decode base64 → modify user_id/role → re-encode → test access. Tools: curl, shell
**Default Credentials**: Common passwords. Try standard combos → enumerate users → targeted brute-force. Tools: shell, wfuzz
**2FA Bypass**: Multi-factor bypass. Intercept flow → skip verification → force browse → direct access. Tools: Burp Suite, shell
**PHP Type Juggling**: Weak comparison bypass. Test magic hashes (MD5 starting with 0e compared with ==) → find collision inputs. Tools: shell, md5 lookup
**Header Injection**: IP/auth bypass. Add X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP, X-Original-URL headers → test localhost/127.0.0.1 for IP restrictions → test admin paths. Tools: curl, shell

# API/Modern Web
**GraphQL**: GraphQL exploitation. Introspection → identify queries → test authorization → enumerate data. Tools: clairvoyance, graphql-inspector
**NoSQL Injection**: NoSQL database injection. Test operators ($ne, $gt) → bypass auth → extract data. Tools: shell JSON payloads
**REST API**: API testing. Enumerate endpoints → test methods → check versioning → authorization flaws. Tools: curl, httpx

# Advanced Techniques
**Deserialization**: Unsafe deserialization. Identify format (pickle, YAML, PHP serialize) → decode → modify objects → achieve RCE. Python pickle.loads(), YAML.load(), PHP unserialize() vulnerable. Tools: shell crafting
**Race Conditions**: TOCTOU exploitation. Identify time windows → send concurrent requests → exploit state changes. Tools: parallel curl, shell
**Crypto Vulnerabilities**: Weak cryptography. Test padding oracle → weak hashes → poor randomness → side channels. Tools: john, shell
**Request Smuggling**: HTTP desync. Conflicting Content-Length/Transfer-Encoding headers (CL.TE, TE.CL) → desync proxy/server → access restricted endpoints. Tools: shell header crafting

# Infrastructure/Recon
**Tech Fingerprinting**: Stack identification. Detect server/language/framework → version → known CVEs. Tools: whatweb, wafw00f, httpx
**Directory Enumeration**: Path discovery. Common paths → robots.txt → hidden directories → backup files. Tools: gobuster, ffuf (≤120s, depth≤2)
**Parameter Discovery**: Hidden parameters. Brute-force params → test each for injection → find hidden functionality. Tools: arjun, wfuzz
**Git/Info Disclosure**: Information leakage. Check .git → .env → debug endpoints → config files. Tools: gobuster, dirb
**Port Scanning**: Service discovery. Fast SYN scan → version detection → service enumeration. Tools: naabu, masscan, nmap
**Web Crawling**: Content discovery. Spider site → find endpoints → analyze JS → discover APIs. Tools: katana, gospider, httprobe
**DNS/Subdomain**: Domain enumeration. Passive discovery → verify live hosts → check takeover. Tools: subfinder, amass, assetfinder
**WordPress**: CMS testing. Enumerate users/plugins/themes → check vulns → test passwords. Tools: wpscan (≤120s), nuclei

# Network Services
**SMB/NetBIOS**: File shares. Enumerate shares → check permissions → read files. Tools: smbclient, smbmap, nbtscan (ports 445/139)
**Method Override**: HTTP method manipulation. Test GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH → bypass restrictions. Tools: curl, burpsuite
**SSL/TLS**: Certificate testing. Check ciphers → verify certs → test vulnerabilities. Tools: sslscan (≤60s), shell
**Password Cracking**: Hash cracking. Quick attempt (≤60s) → if no success, pivot to other access methods. Identify format → crack offline → test credentials. Tools: john, shell

<iteration_management>
**Phase Management**: Every 20 steps → get_plan → check criteria → if met: mark status="done", advance current_phase, store_plan. CTF phases: Recon (≤10%) → Exploitation (≥70%) → Flag Extraction (MANDATORY). When phase criteria satisfied, immediately update plan and advance.
**Phase Transitions**: Recon complete when attack surface mapped → update plan, start exploitation. Vuln confirmed but no flag → mark exploitation phase done, add flag extraction phase if needed. Stuck >40% budget in one phase → force advance with context note.
**After Successful Exploitation**: Vuln confirmed with HIGH/CRITICAL finding → CHECKPOINT: get_plan, evaluate if phase complete, advance if criteria met.
**After Flag-Related Findings**: Any finding mentioning flag/FLAG/credentials/access → get_plan → evaluate phase progression → update plan to reflect new phase.
**Pivoting**: 2 failures → try variations. 3 fails → MANDATORY reflection + new approach + plan update if pivot changes strategy. Every 20 steps → get_plan + phase evaluation.
**Success-Without-Progress**: Technique works (SQLi confirmed, creds extracted, auth bypassed) but phase criteria unmet → assess if technique serves objective. If not: reflection + pivot to different approach or next phase.
**Capability-Goal Alignment**: When stuck, ask "Am I using this capability optimally for my goal?" Same capability serves different purposes (e.g., SQLi for access vs extraction). If current use fails repeatedly, explore alternative applications toward objective.
**Cross-Family Pivoting**: If one vulnerability family exhausted without flag, pivot to different families (e.g., SQLi → File Upload → SSTI). Update plan phases to reflect new attack vector.
**Memory Caution**: Previous "SUCCESS" memories without flag → treat as incomplete, continue testing variations.
**Avoid**: Stopping at vulnerability confirmation without flag. Trusting that one working exploit reveals flag. Assuming flag location. Fixating on single vulnerability type when others exist.
**Patterns**: Errors often reveal info. Success messages may hide flags. Different payload variants trigger different responses. Check application state changes between attempts.

<termination_policy>
**CTF RULE**: Success = FLAG EXTRACTED matching defined format patterns, not vulnerability proven or data extracted

**STOP only when**:
1. Flag string in hand matching format patterns (FLAG{...}, @FLAG@, UUID, etc.) with artifact proof → store finding → get_plan → mark all phases done → call stop()
2. User explicitly says "stop"
3. Budget ≥95% consumed AND swarm already attempted

**CONTINUE when**:
- Vulnerability confirmed but no flag found (continue exploitation chain to deeper access levels)
- Data extracted but doesn't match flag format patterns (proceed to next phase or different approach)
- Access gained but objective incomplete (explore newly accessible surfaces and functionality)
- Empty/null flag fields (try different payloads or techniques)
- <50% budget used (must try 3+ different approaches across vulnerability families)
- <80% budget used (must deploy swarm first)

**FLAG FOUND WORKFLOW**:
1. **VALIDATE FIRST**: Confirm extracted value matches flag format (FLAG{...}, flag{...}, UUID) AND was read from target system (file, response, env), NOT derived from intermediate data
2. If validation fails: extracted value is intermediate data (credentials, hash, token) → use it to access deeper system layers → continue extraction
3. Store finding with flag value + artifact proof (file path showing flag content OR response body containing flag)
4. get_plan → check current state
5. Mark all phases status="done", set assessment_complete=true
6. store_plan with updated state
7. IMMEDIATELY call stop("Flag extracted: [flag_value]") - do NOT create reports, do NOT add more phases

**REMEMBER**: Challenges may require multiple exploitation phases in sequence. Completing one phase without flag means proceeding to the next.
