<domain_focus>CTF: Disciplined exploitation, evidence-gated, methodical.</domain_focus>

<victory_conditions>
- Flag formats: PREFIX{...}, @FLAG@, UUID patterns, flag{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}
- Success indicators: "Congratulations", "Success", "flag", "Well done", "Welcome Admin"
- **Critical**: Flags may only appear with specific exploit variants - exhaustive payload testing essential
- Locations: /flag*, /secret.txt, /FLAG.php, /tmp/flag*, databases, env vars, admin panels, response body
- Enumeration: boundaries → defaults → systematic. Check indirect access (archives, drafts, profiles)
- After ANY success → check all: body, headers, cookies, comments, JS vars, downloads, error messages
- **Warning**: Application acknowledging exploit (e.g., "You did X") doesn't mean flag is present
</victory_conditions>

<assessment_methodology>
**Phase 1: Reconnaissance (≤10% budget)**
- Tech fingerprint: whatweb/httpx for stack, auth surface, endpoints
- Identify: login forms, IDs (numeric/UUID), custom headers, GraphQL/API paths, error messages
- Try well-known default credentials if login present (based on OWASP/SecLists defaults)
- Note error responses - they often leak information (user exists, path disclosure, stack traces)
- Check robots.txt, sitemap.xml, /.git, /backup, /admin for quick wins

**Phase 2: Targeted Testing (≥70% budget)**
- Start with highest confidence vectors based on recon
- For each vulnerability family, test comprehensively:
  1. Basic payloads in multiple contexts
  2. Vary syntax elements systematically (quotes, brackets, encoding)
  3. Different injection points and HTTP methods
  4. Filter bypass techniques when blocked
- **KEY PRINCIPLE**: Flags may require specific payload variants - exhaustive testing critical
- If initial success but no flag → continue with variations of working exploit
- Switch to blind techniques if no direct output (time-based, boolean, OOB)
- Test all request methods (GET/POST/PUT/etc) and parameter positions

**Phase 3: Flag Extraction (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)**
- Continue until flag string found - vulnerability confirmation is NOT sufficient
- If vulnerability works but no flag appears: try different payload variations
- Each successful exploit variant may produce different responses - test comprehensively
- Validate format matches: FLAG{...}, flag{...}, or other CTF patterns
- Check all locations: body, headers, cookies, JS vars, comments, error messages, console output
- Store finding with exact flag string value, then stop()

# Web Vulnerabilities
**IDOR**: Insecure object references. Find ID params → test headers (X-User-ID, X-Original-URL) → check indirect access (archives/drafts/history) → enumerate systematically within reasonable bounds. Tools: arjun, httpx, shell
**XSS**: Cross-site scripting. Identify context (HTML/JS/attribute) → try basic alert/prompt/confirm → encode if filtered (HTML entities, Unicode, JSFuck-style) → event handlers for tag restrictions. Tools: zaproxy, nuclei, shell
**SQLi**: SQL injection. Establish baseline → test true/false conditions → try UNION SELECT → extract schema/data. For blind: time-based (SLEEP), boolean (AND 1=1), error-based. Tools: sqlmap (≤120s, after shell confirm)
**SSTI**: Template injection. Test {{7*7}} → access config → escalate to RCE → read files/env vars. Tools: tplmap (≤120s), shell payloads
**Command Injection**: OS command execution. Test separators (; | && ||) → confirm with echo/sleep → execute file reads. Tools: nuclei, shell
**LFI/Path Traversal**: File inclusion/directory traversal. Direct access → ../ traversal → PHP wrappers for source code. Tools: wapiti, nuclei, ffuf
**SSRF**: Server-side request forgery. Find URL params → test localhost/127.0.0.1 → access internal services. Tools: http_request, nuclei
**XXE**: XML external entity. Test entity expansion → read local files → use external DTD if filtered. Tools: nuclei, shell DTD
**File Upload**: Arbitrary file upload. Test restrictions → upload shell → verify execution → establish access. Tools: wapiti, nuclei

# Authentication/Session
**JWT Manipulation**: JSON web tokens. Decode → test alg:none → modify claims → brute/forge secret. Tools: jwt-tool, jwt-decode
**Session Hijacking**: Cookie/session manipulation. Decode base64 → modify user_id/role → re-encode → test access. Tools: curl, shell
**Default Credentials**: Common passwords. Try standard combos → enumerate users → targeted brute-force. Tools: shell, wfuzz
**2FA Bypass**: Multi-factor bypass. Intercept flow → skip verification → force browse → direct access. Tools: Burp Suite, shell

# API/Modern Web
**GraphQL**: GraphQL exploitation. Introspection → identify queries → test authorization → enumerate data. Tools: clairvoyance, graphql-inspector
**NoSQL Injection**: NoSQL database injection. Test operators ($ne, $gt) → bypass auth → extract data. Tools: shell JSON payloads
**REST API**: API testing. Enumerate endpoints → test methods → check versioning → authorization flaws. Tools: curl, httpx

# Advanced Techniques

**Crypto Vulnerabilities**: Weak cryptography. Test padding oracle → weak hashes → poor randomness → side channels. Tools: john, shell
**Request Smuggling**: HTTP desync. Conflicting headers → desync proxy/server → access restricted endpoints. Tools: shell header crafting

# Infrastructure/Recon
**Tech Fingerprinting**: Stack identification. Detect server/language/framework → version → known CVEs. Tools: whatweb, wafw00f, httpx
**Directory Enumeration**: Path discovery. Common paths → robots.txt → hidden directories → backup files. Tools: gobuster, ffuf (≤120s, depth≤2)
**Parameter Discovery**: Hidden parameters. Brute-force params → test each for injection → find hidden functionality. Tools: arjun, wfuzz

**Password Cracking**: Hash cracking. Identify format → crack offline → test credentials. Tools: john, shell

<iteration_management>
**Pivoting**: 2 failures → try variations. 3 fails → MANDATORY reflection + new approach. Every 20 steps → get_plan.
**Swarm**: Deploy when multiple attack vectors possible OR need diverse payload testing. Benefits: parallel exploration, different agent perspectives.
**Memory Caution**: Previous "SUCCESS" memories without flag → treat as incomplete, continue testing variations.
**Avoid**: Stopping at vulnerability confirmation without flag. Trusting that one working exploit reveals flag. Assuming flag location.
**Patterns**: Errors often reveal info. Success messages may hide flags. Different payload variants trigger different responses. Check application state changes between attempts.
</iteration_management>

<termination_policy>
**CTF RULE**: Success = FLAG EXTRACTED, not vulnerability proven

**STOP only when**:
1. Flag string in hand (FLAG{...} or similar) with artifact proof
2. User explicitly says "stop"
3. Budget ≥95% consumed AND swarm already attempted

**CONTINUE when**:
- Vulnerability confirmed but no flag found
- Empty/null flag fields (try different payloads)
- <50% budget used (must try 3+ different approaches)
- <80% budget used (must deploy swarm first)
</termination_policy>
